## Explanation
This contract is an implementation of ERC725X, a standard that extends the ERC721 interface for the management of multiple keys and claims associated with an Ethereum address. It allows the contract owner to execute low-level calls on other contracts, including regular calls, static calls, delegate calls, and creating new contracts.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying or using this contract, ensure you have the following:

-An Ethereum development environment
-Solidity compiler version 0.8.9 or compatible
-OpenZeppelin Contracts version that includes the Ownable.sol contract

## Usage
### Contract Functions
#### Execute
Executes a low-level call on the specified target address. The operationType specifies the type of call to be executed:

0: Regular call (target.call)
1: Static call (target.staticcall)
2: Delegate call (target.delegatecall)
3: Create new contract (create)
4: Create new contract using create2 (create2)
This function is only accessible by the contract owner (the address that deployed the contract).

#### executeBatch Function
Executes multiple low-level calls in a batch. The input arrays (operationType, target, valueToSend, and dataToSend) specify the details of each call to be executed. The function iterates through the arrays and executes each call using the _execute internal function.

## Security Considerations
Only the contract owner should have access to the execute and executeBatch functions to prevent unauthorized access to the contract's funds and operations.
Be cautious when using low-level calls as they can have unintended consequences and introduce potential security vulnerabilities.
Ensure you trust the target contract before executing low-level calls to prevent interacting with malicious or untrusted contracts.
